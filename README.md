# Country Info App

## Description
A web app I designed while enrolled in [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/). I built this app using Angular and utilizing the [GeoNames API](http://www.geonames.org/). The app allows users to browse and visualize data about countries and their capital cities. Clicking on a country row from the table view will reveal a more detailed view of that country including its flag, map and capital location, and neighboring countries.
